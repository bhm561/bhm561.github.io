        <p>
            First off. I want to mention the 3 most important things to keep in mind when training, and matter of fact generally in life aswell! <br>
            <strong>Number 1.</strong> <br> You have to get enough sleep!!! It's detrimental for your recovery process and development <br>
            <strong>Number 2.</strong> <br> Nutrition. Suuper important to get the rigth kind of fuel in your body. Be sure to eat enough protein, vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts etc. <br>
            <strong>Number 3.</strong> <br> Rest and stretching. I decided to put these two in the same. It's really important to rest properly when you train hard, if your body feels very tired and overworked for longer periods of time, it's probably a good idea to check if you have the first 2 points under control, and then remember to rest! <br>
            Stretching is super important aswell, it's good to be agile to prevent injuries
