            Example
        </legend>
        You can for example train 4 times a week, and each workout let's say you start off with a run, or some other type of cardio, warm up properly. Then you do some strength, low rep, high intensity. And then finnish off with quick bursting movements with high intensity combined with some excercises with a hig rep count. <br>
        Another way of doing it, is to focus on a specific element, for a whole workout. And then circle through the different types of workouts during the week. <br>
        Let's say on monday you do a 45 minute jogg. <br>
        On tuesday you train upper body strength (pull ups or weighted pull ups, bench, shoulder press, dips... ) <br>
        On wednesday you do a ligth 20-30 minute jogg and then some lower body strength (squats, deadlifts, lunges etc.) <br>
        On thursday you rest properly, eat, go sauna if you can. <br>
        On friday you go for a swim <br>
        on saturday you do a full bodyweight workout with push ups, pull ups, sprints, jumps. All of that good stuff. <br>
        On sunday we rest!!!! <br>
        <br>
        Remember. This is only to give you an idea of how one might train. It's important that you find out what works for you, and then you can start building your own program and stick to it. <br> 
        If you don't want to build your own, you're more than welcome to use this one or take from the internet, there's alot of good stuff out there!!
