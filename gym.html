    Well, this section is built for you!

   <p>As a beginner, when going to the gym, first off you want to focus on proper form and technique. (for proper technique, you can check out youtube, it's filled with good videos)<br>
  No need to rush in the beginning, just be sure to get a strong and secure base. Do a lot of the "basics" at first, alot of compound movements. Don't think too much about the weight, just do 4 sets of 8-12 reps with proper technique and so you feel the burn (but not until failure) <br><br> Bench press, squats, shoulder press, dips, pull ups, pull downs, bicep curls, tricep extensions, cable fly's. These are all very good exercises to start with.
Remember to stretch and eat properly, make sure to maintain a proper protein/calorie intake. </p>

  <p>Doing 3-4 sets of 2-6 reps with heavy weights, is considered strength training. <br><br>
3-4 sets, 8-14 reps you're training for hypertrophty (=muscle mass). <br><br>When you exceed the 15 rep bench mark and start increasing the reps and duration of the exercise, you are entering the arena of muscle endurance.</p>

<p>
  Once you're comfortable in the gym and feel like you've got all the basics down (good form on all the "basic" movements) you can start adding more elements to your workout. <br>
  At this point it's good to start figuring out what your goals are in the gym. Do you want to train for muscle mass? You want to get srong? Or perhaps your goal is to increase athleticism. <br>
For a well rounded and balanced workout experience and physical outcome, it's good to include a variety of these consepts in your training,
a good formula to follow is to start of by doing some strength training, 1 or 2 movements in the beginning. Middle workout could be sets of 8-12 reps, and the end could be drop/super-sets & training until failure. <br> If you are inclined towards a certain element in the gym, just add more of it in your workouts, but it's good to keeps things versatile.
