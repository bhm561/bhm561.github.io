            <p>There are a million different ways to train endurance, but we are gonna focus on just a few right here, as to not confuse too much. <br>
            I recommend you start by picking something relatively easy to start with, something low maintenence. For example: running, biking, swimming or bodyweight workouts. </p>

      <fieldset class="level" id="running">

        <p>
           Running is a great way to get started in the world of cardio. <br>
           With running, the only thing you need to get started, is a pair of shoes. <br>
           Once you got that down, you can check out a few videos on YouTube on proper running technique <br>
           If you have a friend or know someone that runs, even better, just ask them for help. <br>
           Once these two steps are completed, you're ready to start your journey. <br>
           It's good to start off slowly, just doing a few km per session, slow jogging, around 3 times a week. <br>
           Just keep doing that, until you feel comfortable doing so, then u can start adding length to your workouts
           </p>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset class="level" id="swimming">
        <legend>Swimming</legend>
        <p>
        If you want to know the best workout you can do to your body as a whole. It's swimming! It works the whole body, without putting any pressure on the joints, thanks to the water element. <br>
        It's good for your muscles, conditioning, lungs, heart and joints. <br>
        If you don't have any technique to get you started, I suggest you do one beginners course at your local swimming hall. If you're a fast learner, you could perhaps also use youtube for learning. It's more up to preference at this point, though you learn better in a group with the instructor physically present. <br>
        Once you have some technique, there not really much to it. Just start by going around 2 to 3 times a week. You'll get better at it, and it'll feel more fluent the more you do it. <br>
        <br>With running, cycling and any other endurance training I would suggest you start by doing it 3 times a week, but because swimming is really demanding and works the whole body head to toe, you could also start by just 2 times a week if you like.

<p>
    You typically want to train 2-3 times a week at first, if you're starting completely form scratch <br>
    If you have some experience under you, or you feel like you are in a decent shape, you should definitively go with 3-5 times a week from the jump, just have a lower intensity at the beginning and gradually build yourself up from there as you start feeling things gettin "easier". <br>
    Your workout length should be from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. Anything more or less is not benefitting you. <br>
    In the beginning it's important to keep the intensity low, just keep to the times and length, and get used to you form of exercise. Once it feels safe and secure, you can start by adding up the intensity and adding more challenge to your workouts. <br>
    But before that, don't rush!!! Take your own time and be patient! It don't matter if it takes you a year to get a good rhytm going, just focus on always doing better than yesterday and last week. That's all that matters!
